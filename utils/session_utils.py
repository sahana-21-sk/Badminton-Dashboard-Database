"""
session_utils.py
────────────────
Single source of truth for reading active data in the dashboard.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Demo data is stored under  st.session_state['demo_*']  keys (loaded at app start).
- Upload data is stored under st.session_state['upload_*'] keys (set by upload_section).
- Every getter below checks for upload data FIRST.
  If an upload has happened → returns upload data.
  If no upload yet           → falls back to demo data.

USAGE (in any section file):
    from utils.session_utils import get_active_analytics, get_active_predictions

    analytics   = get_active_analytics()
    predictions = get_active_predictions()

Never read st.session_state['demo_*'] directly in section files.
Always use these getters so sections switch automatically after upload.

    same root symptom as the squished-skeleton bug, just reintroduced
    through video_path instead of landmarks/predictions.
